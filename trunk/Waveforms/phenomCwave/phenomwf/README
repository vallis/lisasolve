phenomwf

This is a function to calculate the phenomenological waveforms a la 
Santamaria et al ( http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.3306 ). It was stripped out of
my LAL code. It is called with several parameters:

Output:
	wfreal: real part of the output waveform
	wfimag: imaginary part of the output waveform

Input:
	f:	array of frequencies (in Hz)
        n:	length of the frequency array
	df:	resolution of the frequency array
	fMin:	minimum frequency for which to calculate the waveform
	fMax:	maximum frequency for which to calculate the waveform
	eta:	symmetric mass ratio
	chi:	spin parameter
	Mtot:	total mass of the system (in units of solar mass)
	dL:	luminosity distance (in units of MPc)

Some things to note:

fMin and fMax are not necessarily the minimum and maximum frequencies of the
frequency array, f. You can pass a larger array, and the function will only
calculate the waveform for fMin<f<fMax. All other values will be set to zero.

The input frequencies (f, fMin, fMax, df) should be in Hz, not in dimensionless
frequency.

Mtot is in units of solar mass.

The waveform is also set to zero for frequencies fM>0.15.

The waveform has been calculated assuming the Fourier transform conventions
in the paper.

testphenomwf

This is a simple command line tool to demostrate the usage of phenomwf. The 
command line usage is

testphenomwf eta chi Mtot fMin fMax df dL outputfile

The function creates a frequency array from zero to fMax and the
associated wave form arrays. It calculates a waveform and writes the
real and imaginary parts to the outputfile.
