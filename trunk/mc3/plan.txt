=======

- data:		loads the target data, generates noise PSD, does likelihood given a model
			in parallel MPI runs, each worker carries one
- model:	when fed a state and data, makes a model (can handle default parameters)
			in parallel MPI runs, each worker carries one
- state: 	holds the state (a dictionary of parameters), priors
			for parallel tempering, handles parallel multistate
- proposal:	makes proposal distributions
- stepper:	given a state, generates a new one
			can handle parallel-tempering moves (also MPI)
- chain:	collects chain data, holds current state, stores old states compactly
			initialized with data, model, proposal, stepper

- in parallel runs, the worker nodes initialize data and model, then sit in a loop where
  it repeatedly computes models and likelihoods
