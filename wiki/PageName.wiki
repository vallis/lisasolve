#summary Using !MultiNest from Python.

= Python multinest bridge: multinest =

== Installation ==

  * Prerequisites: slightly messy unfortunately; here I describe my latest OS X Snow Leopard install.
    * A working, gcc-compatible Fortran installation (such as gfortran 4.2.1 from http://r.research.att.com/tools).
    * You may have to reinstall numpy once the Fortran is in (for the sake of f2py).
    * A Fortran-aware MPI installation (e.g., Open MPI from http://www.open-mpi.org); the Open MPI shipped with OS X is not.
    * mpi4py from http://mpi4py.scipy.org.
  * The current svn version of the bridge includes the core !MultiNest 2.8 files (from http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/multinest/), plus patched versions of `nested.F90` (which becomes `pynested.F90`), `Makefile`, and the f2py wrapper `nested.pyf`.

== Usage ==

  * Look at `example_eggbox.py`. After initializing MPI and importing `pymultinest`, we need to define a `LogLike(cube, ndim)` function that returns a log likelihood where:
    * `cube` will be a Python list containing the `ndim` search parameters, rescaled to [0,1]; 
    * the function needs to set them (in place) to their physical values (implementing priors with nonlinear transformations if needed);
    * note that `len(cube)` may be larger than `ndim`; this allows returning "nonphysical" parameters that are not used in the search, but reported in output.
  * We then call the !MultiNest executable using `pymultinest.nested.nestRun`. Parameters are explained in the !MultiNest `readme.txt` and in `example_eggbox.py`. Remember to have an empty directory `chains` on hand.
  * With Open MPI, the parallel call would be something like `mpiexec -np 4 python example_eggbox.py`.
